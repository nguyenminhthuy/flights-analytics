# U.S. Flight Operations (2019–2023)

## Overview

This project explores U.S. domestic flight operations from **2019–2023**, focusing on **traffic volume, delays, and disruptions**.
The analysis is **EDA-driven and explainable**, designed to support future **rule-based risk assessment**.

## Data

* Flight-level records (2019–2023)
* Airlines, airports, routes, time, distance
* Outcomes: on-time, delayed, cancelled, diverted

---

## What’s Inside

* Feature engineering (time, distance, routes, geolocation)
* System overview (volume, seasonality, network coverage)
* Operational performance (on-time vs delayed)
* Delay causes & propagation patterns
* Local risk patterns (airports, routes, time of day)
* Disruption analysis (cancellations & diversions)
